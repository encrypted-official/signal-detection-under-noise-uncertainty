Generate a detailed lecture scribe intended strictly for exam preparation. Use only the material provided in the attached lecture slides and permitted textbook context. Treat this context as authoritative. While writing the scribe, explicitly walk through the logical flow of the lecture: introduce definitions and notation first, clearly state assumptions, then present results, proofs, derivations, and worked examples in the same order and manner as they appear in the lecture. Wherever a proof, derivation, or solution is shown in the lecture, reproduce it step by step without skipping intermediate reasoning. Maintain a formal academic structure with clear sections and subsections so that the document can be used as a standalone reference while revising for a closed-notes exam. Do not simplify, reinterpret, or add intuition beyond what is explicitly discussed in the lecture. Do not introduce any new examples or results. Use this same prompt and the same context to generate multiple independent outputs. After generating them, select one single scribe that is the most logically consistent, complete, and faithful to the lecture material. The final output must be written as a LaTeX (.tex) document, ready to compile on Overleaf.
