Generate a lecture scribe suitable for exam preparation. [Follow this step-by-step method: first read and strictly understand the provided context; extract all definitions, assumptions, formulas, derivations, and examples exactly as given; organise the material into logical academic sections; reason sequentially from basic definitions to advanced concepts; derive results step-by-step without skipping intermediate reasoning; include proofs, worked examples, and decision/logic explanations exactly as presented; generate multiple independent reasoning versions using the same prompt and context; compare all versions for logical consistency and completeness; select the single most consistent and accurate version; compile the final structured lecture scribe in clear academic format suitable for exams.] Reason step by step through definitions, assumptions, proofs, derivations, and example solutions exactly as presented in the provided context. Use the same prompt and context across runs. Do not introduce any new material and use your full power! Note: The Lecture scribe contains a .tex (latex) file so that I can run it in overleaf and study systematically Add my name and roll number at the top of each page: Name- Varun Hotani, Roll no.- AU2440132 Give big and best file that you can give.
