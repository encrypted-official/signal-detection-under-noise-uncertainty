Generate an exam-oriented lecture scribe that faithfully reconstructs what was taught in the provided lecture material. Base the scribe strictly and exclusively on the attached lecture slides and the allowed textbook content. Every definition, property, formula, derivation, and example included must be traceable to this context. As you write, make the reasoning explicit: move systematically from definitions to properties, then to derivations and examples, following the lecture’s progression. Any proofs, derivations, or probability calculations shown in the lecture must be written out step by step, preserving the original logical dependencies and assumptions. Organize the scribe into clear academic sections suitable for revision. The goal is accuracy and completeness for exam preparation—not creativity, intuition, or additional explanation. Do not introduce material that is not present in the lecture. Use this identical prompt and identical context to produce multiple independent scribe outputs. Compare them for agreement in reasoning, assumptions, and conclusions, and retain only one final version that is the most consistent and faithful. Output the final scribe as a LaTeX (.tex) file so it can be compiled directly on Overleaf. Add my name and roll number at the top of each page: Name- Parthiv Karangiya Roll no.- AU2440016
