PROMPT-
You are required to generate a lecture scribe intended strictly as exam-oriented reference material. Use ONLY the provided context (lecture slides / lecture PDF). Do NOT introduce any content, examples, explanations, intuition, or results that do not explicitly appear in the provided context. While writing the lecture scribe, reason step by step through the material exactly as it is presented in the lecture. Include explicit reasoning in the scribe wherever the lecture contains: - definitions and notation - assumptions and conditions - theorem or result statements - proofs or proof sketches - derivations - worked examples All reasoning must be faithful to the provided context and must follow the logical order used in the lecture. Make the logical dependencies between concepts explicit so that a student can reconstruct the lecture while revising for an exam. Maintain a formal, academic tone suitable for closed-notes exam preparation. Organize the scribe clearly with appropriate section headings. Do NOT: - invent new examples or explanations - simplify or reinterpret arguments - add intuition not discussed in the lecture - go beyond the scope of the provided context Ensure a clear and logical progression of ideas to facilitate student understanding during revision. This should serve as concise and accurate exam reference material. Also cover each and every topic do NOT skip any single topic or examples.
